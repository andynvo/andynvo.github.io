    <h1>Renal #1 - Intro to Renal System</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to the renal system!  In the next 3 weeks (which is way too short), we will cover everything there is to know about the  reanl system. Below is a brief overview of CV and how I would approach this system. Like in most systems, I'll note what is high-yield for UVA<sup>&#x1f534;</sup> and what's high-yield for Step 1<sup>&#x1f7e1;</sup>.</p>

    <p>The urinary system comprises of the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. The two kidneys lie retroperitoneal (recall <span style="color: red; font-weight: 700;">SAD PUC<u>K</u>ER</span>) and inferior to the liver and the spleen on the right and left side, respectively. Note that the <u>right</u> kidney has a longer a<u>r</u>tery and the left kidney has a longer vein. The outer most layer of the kidney is the capsule. Moving inward, there is the renal cortex, the medulla, the minor calyces, the major calyces, the renal pelvis, and the ureter. The kidney is divided into lobes, which comprises the medullary pyramid, the portion of the medulla, and the portion of the cortex above it, separated by interlobar arteries.</p>
    <p>The functional unit of the kidney is called a <b>nephron</b> which comprises an <b>afferent arteriole</b> (bring blood into the nephron), an <b>efferent arteriole</b> (taking blood away from the nephron), the <b>glomerulus</b> (where blood content are intially filtered), the <b>proximal convoluted tubule</b> (PCT), the <b>loop of Henle</b> (consisting of the descending limb, the thick ascending limb, and the thin ascending limb), the <b>distal convoluted tubule</b> (DCT), and the <b>collecting tubule</b>. The blood flow to and from the kidney is as follow: abdominal aorta &rarr; renal artery &rarr; segmental artery &rarr; interlobar artery &rarr; arcuate artery &rarr; afferent arteriole &rarr; glomerulus &rarr; efferent arteriole &rarr; vasa recta/peritubular capillaries &rarr; venous outflow &rarr; renal vein &rarr; IVC. The left renal vein receives blood from two addtional sources&mdash;left suprarenal and left gonadal veins. Despite high overall renal blood flow, the renal medulla receives significantly less blood flow than the cortex, making it more susceptible to hypoxia.<sup>&#x1f534;</sup><sup>&#x1f7e1;</sup> Nephrons can be dividied into 2 groups: <b>cortical nephrons</b> (85%) and <b>juxtamedullary nephrons</b> (15%). In cortical nephrons, the thick ascending limb and thick descending limb are mostly in the medullary ray (which are just radially directed segments of the loop of Henle). In juxtamedullary nephrons, the thick ascending and thick descending limb are in the medulla.</p>
    <img src="img/Glomerulus_cross-section_FirstAid_2020_p580.png" alt="Cross-section of glomerulus" width="350" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
    <p>The glomerulus receives blood flow from the afferent arteriole, and blood content (glucose, proteins, etc.) diffuse through the endothelium into Bowman's space, the space enclosed by podocytes of the kidneys.  These interditgitating podocytes form filtration slits and are joined together by slit diaphragms (not any junctional complexes), and it is through these slits that plasma content transits from the Bowman's space into the proximal convoluted tubule. The parietal layer of the Bowman's capsule (the side not interfacing with the endothelium, is composed of simple squamous epithelium, which is contiguous with the PCT. </p>
    <p>Continuing down the nephron is the PCT which comprises "cuboidal" epithelial cells. On the apical surface (facing the PCT lumen), these epithelial cells contain various transports such as <b>aquaporin-1</b>, <b>Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose co-transporter (SGLT2)</b>, <b>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger</b>, <b>Na<sup>+</sup>-phosphate co-transporter</b>, and <b>Na<sup>+</sup>-amino acid co-transporter</b>. On the basolateral surface (facing the basement membrane and the peritubular vessels) are <b>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase</b> which provides the Na<sup>+</sup> absorption into the bloodstream and concentration gradient necessary to maintain the other transport systems. Cells of the PCT also contain brush border where carbonic anhydrase &#8547; is active, turning H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> into water and CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the nephron is made of cuboidal epithelial cells.  In the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, these cells contain aquaporin-1 and urea transporter, making this segment permeable to water and urea which regulates the osmolarity of the kidney medulla. In the thick ascending loop of Henle, the cells contain <b>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2 Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter (NKCC)</b> and outward K<sup>+</sup> channels on their apical surface and <b>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase</b> and outward K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> channels on their basolateral surface. The distal convoluted tubule is interesting because it contacts its own glomerulus, enabling tubuloglomerular feedback (to be discussed in the physiology portion). At the contact site, the distal tubule cells are narrow and closely spaced forming the <b>macula densa</b> which is a part of the <b>juxtaglomerular apparatus</b>. Cells of the DCT contain <b>Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter</b> and inward-facing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on its apical surface and <b>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase</b>, <b>Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger</b>, and outward Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. The collecting tubule is also unique in that it contains three different epithelial cell types&mdash;principal cells, &alpha;-intercalated cells, and &beta;-intercalated cells.</p>
