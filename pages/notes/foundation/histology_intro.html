    <h2 id="terms">Tissue Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tissue (Greek <i>histós</i>): a collection of cells that work together to perform one or more specialized functions</li>
        <li>Parenchyma: the functional tissue of an organ as distinguished from the connective and supporting tissue. When looking at gross organs, parenchyma is often used to describe the tissue in its entirety.</li>
        <li>Stroma: the supportive tissue of an organ (typically epithelial organ) consisting of the connective tissues, blood vessels, and nerves. This can generally only be separated from the parenchyma at the microscopic level.</li>
        <li>Morphology: the overall characteristics of a tissue or cell
            <ul>
                <li>Architecture: refers to the low power microscopic features of the tissues and what kind of structures, if any, they are forming (i.e., glands, nests, sheets, layers, fascicles, papillae, villa)</li>
                <li>Cytology: single cell features such as size, shape, characteristics of nuclear membrane, chromatin, cytoplasm, and nucleus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Lumen: the cavity of a tubular or hollow organ</li>
        <li>Epithelium: the cellular covering of internal and external body surfaces and organs. It consists of tightly joined cells and is classified according to the number of layers and the shape of the cells.</li>
        <li>Interstitium: the place between cells in an organ. This is often the place where fluid can accumulate (edema), cells can infiltrate (i.e., inflammation), or matrix can be laid down (e.g., collagen)</li>
        <li>Mesenchyme: the part of the embryonic mesoderm from which connective tissues, bone, cartilage, and the circulatory and lymphatic systems develop. It is largely synonymous with connective tissue. In practice, muscle and peripheral nerve are also referred to as mesenchymal tissue.</li>
        <li>Mucosa: linings of mostly endodermal origin, covered by epithelium, which line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tissue-types">Tissue Types</h2>
    <p>Generally, there are four basic tissue types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>epithelium,</li>
        <li>connective tissue,</li>
        <li>nervous tissue, and</li>
        <li>muscle.</li>
    </ul>
