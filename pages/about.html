                <p>Andy came to the United States of America from Vietnam when he was young with his parents and grandparents and grew up in Henrico County, Virginia. As a young child, he had a very impactful with a surgeon that treated him, and thus, he aspired to become to a doctor to one day be able to deliver the same kind of care to others. He attended Godwin High School Center for Math and Science (now Todd Allen Phillips Center for Medical Sciences). During his time in high school, he became interested in transplant medicine and decided to pursue a degree in biomedical engineering (BME) to study tissue engineering for the purpose of improving treatment for transplant patients. In college, Andy joined a BME research lab under Dr. Olivares Navarette and learned that a lot of research was still needed before tissue engineering can be applied in clinic. Thus, Andy decided to pursue a Ph.D. in addition an M.D. to further the research effort and eventually translate said research to the bedside.</p> 
                <p>Andy's research experiences have covered the spectrum from basic to translational to clinical research; from investigating mechanisms of macrophage reaction to implanted biomaterials, development of neural tisuse cultures of drug screening to address the opioid crisis, and development of a new clinical score to predict complications following rib fracture injury. As a scientist and engineer, Andy is personally interested in vascular tissue engineering in the context of the liver and hopes to one day be able to succeed in creating an organ (or piece of) for transplant. For that reason, he also devotes time to learn about the process of translating academic lab success to clinical trials, outside of the traditional M.D./Ph.D. curriculum.</p>
                <p>Outside of the biomedical field, Andy is also interested in physics (being an engineer), and outside of those, he is interested in foreign languages and comparative linguistics. His hobbies include reading novels, watching Netflix, drawing, and writing.</p>
